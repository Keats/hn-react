# HackerNews in React

Using the API described at https://github.com/HackerNews/API via plain HTTPS, not
FireBase SDK.

Design is based on the dark theme of [Materialistic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.hidroh.materialistic&hl=en).


## Get started

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

And go to `http://localhost:8080/` afterwards

## Missing
- More than 1 page of top stories
- Other type of feed: ask hn/show hn/etc
- Author page

## TODOs
- See if using firebase SDK avoids doing 100s of HTTPS requests?
